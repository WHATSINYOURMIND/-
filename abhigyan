Data Definition Language(DDL)
DDL commands are used to perform various operations on the structure/schema of the Database.
CREATE is used for creation of a table.
ALTER is used to modify/drop/add existing columns and constraints in a table. It can also be used for renaming them.
DROP deletes the whole table with its contents entirely. Cannot ROLLBACK.
TRUNCATE Keeps the column headings and deletes all the data(tuples) in the table. Cannot ROLLBACK.
RENAME used to Rename columns or even the whole table.

Data Manipulation Language(DML)
DML commands are used to perform various operations on the data inside the Database.
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE is used to modify or perform calculations on the data.
DELETE works like truncate but a WHERE clause can select and delete specific tuples according to user. ROLLBACK possible before COMMIT.
Data Control Language(DCL)
DCL commands are used to control various privilages to different users of the Database.
Transactional Control Language(TCL)
TCL commands are used to control transactions in the Database. Assists in implementing ACID properties.
Constraints
Often we need to ensure that data in our database follows some set of rules specified by us. Constraints let us to implement these rules on the data.
PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE + NOT NULL.
FOREIGN KEY assists in referencing between two tables.
CHECK checks if the input is inside the user defined domain.
UNIQUE does not let duplicate values exist in that column.
DEFAULT assigns a user defined value by default to that column.
NOT NULL makes it compulsory to enter some value.
